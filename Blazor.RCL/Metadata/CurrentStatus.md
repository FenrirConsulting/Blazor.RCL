### Notification Database Schema Fix
**Date:** May 10, 2024
**Decision:** Update notification system database schema and entity mappings

**Context:** The notification system was experiencing SQL errors due to mismatches between entity properties in the code and columns in the database tables.

**Issue Details:**
- Missing columns: `IsRead`, `Metadata_EntityId`, `Metadata_EntityType`, `Metadata_ActionUrl`, `DeliveryAttempts`
- Entity Framework was mapping `NotificationMessage` and `NotificationOutboxMessage` to database tables lacking these columns

**Solution:**
1. Created a comprehensive database schema update script (UpdateNotificationSchema.sql)
2. Updated AppDbContext entity configurations to properly map complex types
3. Added detailed documentation of the issue and solution (NOTIFICATION_SCHEMA_FIX.md)

**Consequences:**
- Eliminated SQL errors during notification operations
- Improved reliability of the notification system
- Enhanced maintainability through proper documentation
- Ensured consistent database schema across environments

### Implementation of Claude Layer Metadata
**Date:** May 6, 2024
**Decision:** Implement Claude Layer Metadata system for project documentation

**Context:** The project needed improved documentation that could be easily used in LLM interactions to maintain context across multiple sessions.

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. Traditional documentation in README files
2. Wiki-based documentation
3. Code comments only

**Rationale:** The Claude Layer Metadata approach provides a structured, machine-readable format that is optimized for LLM interactions while still being human-readable. It allows for more effective collaboration with AI assistants like Claude.

**Consequences:**
- Improved ability to discuss and modify the project with LLM assistance
- Better documentation organization
- Additional maintenance overhead for metadata files
- Better onboarding for new developers

## 📈 Next Steps
1. Complete AKeyless integration testing
2. Finalize RabbitMQ message queue implementation
3. Update remaining metadata documentation files
4. Performance profiling and optimization
5. Integration testing with dependent applications
